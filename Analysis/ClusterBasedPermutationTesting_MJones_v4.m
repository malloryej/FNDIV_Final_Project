%% Cluster Based Permutation for ERP Analysis %%
% written for data collected with predictive T-Maze task using 32 electrode EEG montage
% preprocessed and exported from BrainVision Analyzer v 2.3.0
% Two primary components of this script:
    % 1) Parametric testing and clustering (Quantifying effect at every timepoint) - T-test at every millisecond of the ERP
        % T-test is used in this case for rumination data (i.e. either high
        % or low)
        % After testing, identify all effects greater than some parameter
        % (i.e. alpha < 0.05 or alpha < 0.01)
        % AVERAGE OR SUM all t-statistics or F-values at each electrode across all time points
            % This script specifies a cluster as having a significance values
            % (i.e. p-value) < 0.05 over the course of 10 or more consecutive
            % milliseconds.
                % These cluster parameters can be changed based on the user's preferences
    % 2) Permutation testing
        % Randomly redistribute or "scramble" data and reassign to two new
        % groups
        % repeat parametric testing and clustering steps nPermutations times to
        % create a null distribution; you will choose the largest effect
        % size from each permutation to add to the null distribution (i.e.
        % null distribution will consist of nPermutations total measures)
        % clusters with SUM OR AVERAGE of test statistics >= than the 95
        % percentile will be considered significant

%% T-tests %%
% Runs a t-test comparing amplitude of EEG from ruminators versus
% non-ruminators at every millisecond of the ERP

% Set up key variables
groups = data.Ruminator; % creates a variable to indicate whether participant was/was not a ruminator; edit to match your category label
channels = data.Channel; % creates a variable to hold channel information
timepointData = table2array(data(:, 4:end)); % creates an array that holds all of the amplitudes at every channel at every timepoint
uniqueChannels = unique(channels); % makes a list of unique channels being examined; should match input selected in preproc script

% initialize empty array for results
results = cell(nChannels, timePoints);

for c = 1:length(uniqueChannels) % sets channel for each round of t-tests; each "round" of t-tests is conducted for one channel at a time 
    channelData = timepointData(strcmp(channels, uniqueChannels{c}), :); % extracts data only from channel currently being evaluated
    channelGroups = groups(strcmp(channels, uniqueChannels{c})); % creates channel specific variable to separate ruminator from nonruminators

    % separates ruminator channel data from nonruminator channel data
    ruminators = channelData(channelGroups == 1, :);
    nonruminators = channelData(channelGroups == 2, :);

    for t = 1:timePoints % performs t-test at every timepoint for each channel

    % Perform t-test
