%% Cluster Based Permutation for ERP Analysis %%
% written for data collected with predictive T-Maze task using 32 electrode EEG montage
% preprocessed and exported from BrainVision Analyzer v 2.3.0
% Two primary components of this script:
    % 1) Parametric testing and clustering (Quantifying effect at every timepoint) - T-test/ANOVA at every millisecond of the ERP
        % T-test is used in this case for rumination data (i.e. either high
        % or low)
        % ANOVA is used for learning style data (i.e. random, choice kernel, win
        % stay lose shift, or Riscorla-Wagner)
        % After testing, identify all effects greater than some parameter
        % (i.e. alpha < 0.05 or alpha < 0.01)
        % sum all t-statistics or F-values at each electrode across all time points
            % This script specifies a cluster as an effect size with
            % p-value < 0.05 over the course of 10 or more consecutive
            % milliseconds between 3 or more adjacent electrodes. This
            % definition of cluster can be changed based on the user's
            % preferences
    % 2) Permutation testing
        % Randomly redistribute data in groups consistent with conditions
        % (i.e. for low and high ruminators, there will be two groups and
        % for learning styles there will be four groups)
        % repeat parametric testing and clustering steps nPermutations times to
        % create a null distribution; you will choose the largest effect
        % size from each permutation to add to the null distribution (i.e.
        % null distribution will consist of nPermutations total measures)
        % clusters with sum of the test statistics >= than the top 5
        % percentile will be considered significant
